- I interned with the AWS Amazon Connect Team this summer. Amazon Connect builds modern contact centers used by businesses and organizations worldwide.

- The primary goal of my internship was to experiment with and implement new versions of the routing algorithm that matches contacts with agents in the contact center. I particularly enjoyed the open-ended nature of my internship project. Throughout this period, I conducted extensive research on algorithmic designs. Over the course of the internship, I had the opportunity to delve into various areas, including classical queueing theory, control systems, metrics collection, data visualization, and proof-of-concept programming.

- Moreover, I had the privilege of familiarizing myself with Amazon's engineering culture and exploring the internal tools and resources that Amazonians use in their daily work. It has been an invaluable and enriching learning experience."
