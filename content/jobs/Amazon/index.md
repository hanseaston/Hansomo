- I interned at the AWS Amazon Connect Team during this summer. Amazon Connect builds a modern contact center for businesses and organizations across the world.

- The goal of my internship is to experiment and implement new versions of the routing algorithm that matches contacts with agents in the contact center. I enjoy the open-ended nature of my internship project. I researched extensively on algorithmic designs, and throughout the internship, I had the chance learn classical queueing theory, control system, metrics collection, data visualization, and proof-of-concept programming.

- I also had a chance to learn and explore the engineering cultures at Amazon and familiarize myself with the internal tools and resources Amazonians use in their everyday job. It has been a great learning experience.
