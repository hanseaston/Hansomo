I am a student majoring in computer science at [University of Washington](https://www.cs.washington.edu/).

Currently looking for a new grad SWE role in 2024.

I work on things that can make people's lives better, even just slightly.
This includes teaching and contributing to open source projects.

I learn quick, and I enjoy doing it.
Creativity, teamwork, and impact is why I decide to pursue a degree in CS.
Here's a few new technologies that I love working with.
