For my final open-ended project in the Android programming course, I collaborated in a team of three to create a context-aware Android app using Java. I utilized the Google Awareness API to provide users with weather information specific to our campus. Furthermore, I implemented the feature to display pictures of the closest campus building based on the user's current location, making the app context-aware and user-friendly.
