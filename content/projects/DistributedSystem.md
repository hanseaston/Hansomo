I worked on a quarter-long class project to build a linearizable, sharded key-value store with support for multi-key updates and dynamic load balancing. This system is designed to offer functionality similar to Amazon's DynamoDB or Google's Spanner. I implemented classical primary-backup and Paxos systems to support the distributed key-value store.
