- I served as a teaching assistant for the Data Structures and Parallelism course offered at UW CSE. Data structures have always been a favorite subject of mine, and I'm enthusiastic about sharing my knowledge with fellow students to help them succeed.

- My responsibilities included conducting hour-long review sessions with approximately 30 students each week, where I covered various topics. These topics encompassed asymptotic analysis, the application of fundamental data structures such as heaps, trees, hash tables, concurrency, parallelism, and graph algorithms.

- In addition to the review sessions, I hosted office hours to assist students in understanding and debugging their Java programming projects. The course featured programming projects that required students to implement classic data structures like heaps, AVL trees, and hash tables from scratch. To aid students in debugging, I utilized IntelliJ debugger tools and conducted JUnit tests.
