I constructed a search engine that allows users to look up keywords in a local file database. I used C to implement the file system crawler and word indexer. In C++, I implemented the word query processor. Finally, I converted the index file into an architecture-neutral form to store on disk and created a server-side listening socket to handle clients' HTTP requests.
