Worked as a part-time summer intern for Project Sidewalk - an innovative web-based tool that aims to improve accessibility for people with mobility impairments. Worked on the front-end design of the website using Javascript, HTML, and CSS. Participated weekly Hackathon for Seattle city street label validations and collaborated with other team members to incorporate Scala logic into the codebase.
