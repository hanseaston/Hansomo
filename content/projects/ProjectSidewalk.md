I worked as a part-time summer intern for Project Sidewalk, an innovative web-based tool focused on enhancing accessibility for individuals with mobility impairments. During my internship, I primarily contributed to the front-end design of the website, utilizing Javascript, HTML, and CSS. I also actively participated in weekly Hackathons, specifically focusing on Seattle city street label validations, and collaborated closely with fellow team members to integrate Scala logic into the project's codebase.
