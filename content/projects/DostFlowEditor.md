I participated in Microsoft's Hackathon in Seattle and worked as part of a three-person team to develop an admin dashboard for the educational website Dost, which is based in India. We used React for the frontend and Flask for the backend. One of our notable achievements was successfully integrating a React flow editor library into the main codebase to streamline the workflow of the WhatsApp chatbot for the website.
