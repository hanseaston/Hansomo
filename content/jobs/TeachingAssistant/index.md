- I was a teaching assistant for the data structure and parallelism course. Data structure has been one of my favorite subjects, and I want to share my excitement with other students and help them succeed.

- I taught hour-long review section to roughly 30 students every week and went over practice problems with them. More specifically, I taught topics on asymptotic analysis, application of fundamental data structures (heap, tree, hash table, etc), concurrency, parallelism, and graph algorithms.

- I also held office hours to help students understand and debug Java programming projects. The course had programming projects that required students to implement classic data structures - heap, AVL tree, hash table, etc - from scratch. I used IntelliJ debugger tools and Junit tests to help students debug.
