- I spent three months interning at Spot, a four-person startup that's pioneering a revolutionary 3D remote work platform. Spot's mission is to recreate the spirit and practicality of sharing a physical office within a digital realm.

- During my internship, I had the honor of working closely with Spot's two co-founders, Gordon and Wes, who also co-founded Outreach, a sales engagement company with over a thousand employees. Learning from both of them was an invaluable experience. I gained insights into their unique approach to rapidly developing features that customers desire and their technical prowess in constructing the entire application from the ground up.

* I learned many exciting new technologies related to full-stack development, including Apollo, React, GraphQL, NestJS, TypeORM, TypeScript, BabylonJS, and Playwright, just to name a few. I thoroughly enjoyed the highly agile development process exclusive to brand new startups, like Spot. The new features I implemented during the internship were promptly merged into production upon approval, and customers was able to directly use them. It was a blast.
