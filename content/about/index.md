Hey there! I'm Hans, a student currently studying at [University of Washington](https://www.washington.edu/). I am graduating with a Master's degree June 2022.

Currently looking for software engineering internships in 2021.

I work on things that can make people's lives better, even just slightly.
This can be in the form of volunteering, coding, teaching, and many others.

I learn quick, and I enjoy doing it.
Creativity, teamwork, and impact is what I love about CS.
Here's a few new technologies I've learned over the summer.
