I implemented a chess bot using the Negamax and Jamboree algorithms. To maximize the efficiency of the searching algorithm, I applied alpha-beta pruning and parallelism through Java's Fork-Join Pool. Additionally, I enhanced the chess bot's performance by incorporating iterative deepening and employing move ordering strategies, including the Killer heuristic and MVV-LVA (Most Valuable Victim - Least Valuable Attacker).
