I created a fully operational drawing application that allows users to draw on the canvas while providing support for undo and redo actions. To enhance accessibility, I incorporated content descriptions for widgets within the application. Additionally, I implemented collapsible sidebars that offer a range of stroke thickness and color options, both through XML configuration and programmatically.
