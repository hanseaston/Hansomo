During the pandemic, acquiring groceries has become quite a challenge. In response, several people in our Seattle neighborhood initiated a non-profit community service, delivering fresh produce directly to people's doors. The next phase of our expansion is the development of an e-commerce shop, a full-stack application built from scratch using modern technologies. I created this application as an open-source project with the hope that more developers can utilize it to support their own neighborhoods.
