I enhanced the back-end of a chat application by implementing several custom data structures, including AVL Trees, Hash Tables, Hash Trie Maps, and more. These data structures were used to optimize various features within the application. Additionally, I introduced auto-correction, auto-complete, and word-suggestion functionalities by integrating multiple sorting algorithms with an imported dictionary.
