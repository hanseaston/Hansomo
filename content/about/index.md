Hey there! I'm Hans, an aspiring software engineer currently studying at [Univeristy of Washington](https://www.washington.edu/).

I enjoy working on things that people care about, I care about. That can be in the form of volunteering, programming, writing, and anything, really.
 
I fell in love with programming three years ago. Creativity, teamwork, and impact is what I care about in CS.

I learn quick, and I enjoy doing it. Here's a few from this summer.
