Participated in the Microsoft's Hackathon in Seattle. Worked in a team of three to develop an admin dashboard for the educational website Dost, based in India. Used React on the frontend with Flask on the backend. Successfully integrated a React's flow editor library into the main codebase in order to streamline the Whatsapp chatbot's workflow for the website.
