- I grow up loving Math
- I like to learn on Math on my own
- I competed in various Olympiad Math competitions in middle school
- My faviorite place to study Math is Piazza Hut, they got infinite refills and quality air conditioning. I used to go there everyday, from 2 - 6pm, and order a piazza to-go for dinner
- This happened 8 years ago, in Shanghai, where I grew up
