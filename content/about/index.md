Hey there! My name is Hans. I am a student majoring in computer science at [University of Washington](https://www.washington.edu/).

Currently looking for new opportunities for the year 2022!

I work on things that can make people's lives better, even just slightly.
This can be in the form of volunteering, coding, teaching, and many others.

I learn quick, and I enjoy doing it.
Creativity, teamwork, and impact is why I decide to pursue a degree in CS.
Here's a few new technologies that I love working with.
