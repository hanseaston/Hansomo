I built the core functionalities of Tetris using Ruby, following the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern to structure the game. In addition to the basic gameplay, I implemented multiple game modes and introduced point boost mechanisms to enhance the gaming experience. This project was a part of my Programming Languages class and demonstrated my proficiency in designing and implementing interactive games using Ruby.
