I developed a simplified database management system in Java. This system was designed to handle client SQL queries effectively. To ensure database concurrency correctness, I implemented a two-phase locking mechanism, and for recoverability, I utilized a log file scheme. The project involved building core components of the DBMS, including the Buffer Pool Manager, Lock Manager, Log Manager, Query Parser, and Query Optimizer.
