I implemented a Naive Bayes Classifier in Java to detect spam emails. In this project, I applied fundamental machine learning concepts such as Bayes' theorem, conditional probability, and Laplace smoothing to build the classification algorithm. The classifier achieved an impressive accuracy of approximately 95%, with only 27 out of 500 emails incorrectly classified as spam. This project demonstrated my ability to develop effective machine learning solutions for practical applications like email spam detection.
