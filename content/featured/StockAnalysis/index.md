I started this open-source project during my college Deep Learning course. The primary goal of this project is to experiment with whether a deep learning model can successfully predict stock price movements, using historical market data from the past decade. If the predictions are accurate enough, I hope to use them as a basis for my trading decisions. I implemented the data collection, preprocessing, and cleaning pipelines for this project. As for the model, I implemented an LSTM model with adversarial training, based on a research paper. The project is still a work in progress that I will continue to dedicate more time to next year :\)
