Built a search engine that allows users to look up keywords in a local file database.
Used C to implement file system crawler and word indexer. Used C++ to implement word
query processor. Converted the index file into architecture-neutral form to store in disk
Created server-side listening socket to handle clientâ€™s HTTP requests.
