I implemented the free, malloc, and realloc functions utilizing an explicit free list. Additionally, I designed a garbage collector that employs the mark and sweep algorithm to recursively identify and reclaim unused memory within the program. These memory management and garbage collection techniques are crucial for efficient and effective memory utilization in software applications.
