- I had the honor to intern at Spot, a brand new startup building a revolutionary 3D remote work platform. Spot aims to bring the spirit and utility of sharing the same physical office to a digital experience.

- I worked directly with the two co-founders, Gordon and Wes, who have also co-founded Outreach, a sales engagement company of more than a thousand employees. I learned so much from both of them - their unique way to quickly develop features customers want, and their technical expertise in building the entire application from scratch.

* I learned many new exciting technologies related to full stack development - Apollo, React, GraphQL, NestJS, TypeORM, TypeScript, BabylonJS, Playwright - just to name a few. I enjoyed the aggressively agile development process that's only exclusive to brand new startups, like Spot. New features I have implemented throughout the internship are quickly merged to production upon approval, and customers will directly use them and provide us feedback.
