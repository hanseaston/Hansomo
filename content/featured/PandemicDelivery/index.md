During the ongoing pandemic, getting groceries can sometimes be a real challenge. Several people in our Seattle neighborhood started a non-profit community service and delivered fresh produce to people's doors directly. The e-commerce shop, a full-stack application using modern technologies built from scratch, is our next phase of expansion. I built this application as an open-source project in hope that more developers can use it for their own neighborhoods.
